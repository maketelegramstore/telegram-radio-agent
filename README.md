# ðŸ“» Telegram Radio Channel Agent: Turning Text into an Audio Stream

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to transform a regular text-based Telegram channel into a full-fledged "radio station," where each new text post is automatically converted into a voice message and added to a sequential playlist. The goal is to create a unique user experience, allowing subscribers to consume content in audio format, similar to listening to radio or podcasts.

## "Telegram Radio" Concept

The essence of the idea lies in automating the process of converting channel text content into audio. When a new text post is published in the channel, a specially developed **AI agent** intercepts it, generates a voice message based on the text, and publishes it under the original post. Telegram automatically recognizes the sequence of audio files and allows them to be played continuously, creating a radio stream effect.

## Advantages and Use Cases

Our AI agent opens up entirely new horizons for using Telegram channels, going beyond simple "radio for owners":

* **Accessibility and Convenience:** Allows subscribers to consume content "on the go" â€” while driving, cooking, exercising, without needing to constantly look at the screen. Just turn it on and listen!
* **Audience Expansion:** Attracts users who prefer audio format over reading, making content more inclusive.
* **New Content Format:** Opens up possibilities for creating unique audio podcasts, news summaries, audiobooks, or educational materials directly within Telegram.
* **Increased Engagement:** Voice accompaniment makes content more lively and personal, strengthening the emotional connection with the audience.

### Personalized Learning and Development

Imagine your Telegram channel becoming a personal tutor or a source of knowledge:

* **Foreign Language Learning:** The AI agent can generate foreign language lessons (e.g., English, Spanish) with audio pronunciation of words and phrases in two languages, including transcription. Forget boring "London is the capital" â€“ get targeted, applicable lessons by immersing yourself in interesting stories.
* **Specialized Knowledge:** For programmers, lawyers, doctors â€“ AI can explain complex terms and concepts, vocalizing them in an understandable format, including professional slang.
* **Creating Audiobooks and Explanations:** Upload a book text or a complex article, and the agent will convert it into audio format in parts. You can listen to it at your convenience, and also ask the AI to explain unclear fragments, which will also be voiced.

### Advanced AI Agent Features

Our agent doesn't just convert text to voice; it does so intelligently:

* **Intelligent Text Processing:** Before voicing, the agent can "refine" the text, adapting it for natural auditory perception. For example, abbreviations like "ÑƒÐ»." (ulitsa - street) will be expanded to "ÑƒÐ»Ð¸Ñ†Ð°", dates and numbers will be voiced in a human-friendly format (e.g., "June 18, 2025" instead of "18 06 2025"). This significantly improves audio quality and makes it pleasant to listen to.
* **Multi-Speaker Capability:** The option to use **two different voices** (out of **30 available**) in a single audio post is available. This allows for creating dialogues, interviews, or assigning roles in educational content.
* **Automatic Language Detection:** The Text-to-Speech (TTS) model used (Gemini TTS) automatically detects the language of the text for correct voicing from **24 supported languages**:
  * Russian, English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Arabic, Hindi, Indonesian, Dutch, Polish, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese, Romanian, Ukrainian, Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu.

## Publication Modes and Control

We offer flexible agent operation modes so you can fully control the process:

1. **Fully Automatic with Correction:** The agent automatically processes the text (abbreviation expansion, number formatting) and publishes the audio to the channel.
2. **Fully Automatic without Correction:** The agent generates audio from the text "as is" and publishes it, without prior intelligent processing.
3. **Manual Control at Each Stage:** For the most demanding users, a step-by-step mode is provided:
  * You can **review and edit** the text after its intelligent processing by the agent.
  * **Listen** to the generated audio before publishing.
  * **Manually confirm** the audio publication to the channel.This ensures maximum control over the final result.

## How It Works (High-Level)

1. **Channel Monitoring:** The **AI agent** constantly monitors for new text publications in the specified Telegram channel.
2. **Intelligent Processing (optional):** Upon detecting a new post, the text can go through a preliminary AI processing stage to improve its sound (abbreviation expansion, number and date formatting).
3. **Audio Generation:** The processed text is sent to a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service (Gemini TTS) based on artificial intelligence, with the option to select voices (including multi-speaker capability).
4. **Audio Publication (automatic or manual):** The generated audio file is published in the same channel as a reply to the original text post or as a separate message below it, depending on the selected mode.
5. **Sequential Playback:** Telegram automatically groups audio messages, allowing users to play them sequentially, creating the effect of a continuous audio stream.

## Economic Model and Availability

We strive to make this technology as accessible as possible:

* **Free AI Keys:** The project uses **Gemini Flash** for speech synthesis, which allows generating **up to 15 TTS requests per day for free**. Given that a single Telegram post (up to 4096 characters) easily fits into one generation, this limit is more than sufficient for most channels and personal use.
* **Scaling for Industrial Use:** For industrial-scale use (e.g., 100-200 messages per day), there is an option to pay for additional generations directly through the Gemini API. This also provides access to more advanced Gemini TTS models, although the free Gemini Flash version already offers high-quality voicing, supports 24 languages, and provides exactly 30 different voices.
* **Hosting and Support:** Despite free keys, the agent requires hosting and ongoing support, as AI technologies and APIs are constantly evolving.
* **Flexible Monetization:** To cover infrastructure and development costs, we offer two models:
  * **Small advertisements:** Integration of non-intrusive ads into the content or interface.
  * **Minimal subscription:** An estimated cost of just $2 per month. This is a symbolic amount for both owners of large Telegram channels and individual users (e.g., students learning a language) who wish to access advanced AI capabilities.

## Who Is This Project For

* Telegram channel owners looking to present content innovatively and expand their audience.
* Developers interested in integrating AI (TTS, NLP) with the Telegram API and creating autonomous agents.
* Anyone who wants to create a unique and convenient way to deliver information, personalize learning, or automate content.
